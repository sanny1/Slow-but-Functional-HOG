# Slow but Functional Histogram of gradients

There are three main function in HOG.py file which are:

1. Sobel operater
   Takes in an image as an argument and returns edges in the image and gradients
   image.

2. Visualisation Histogram of Gradients
   Takes in HOG values and the dimensions of the image as well as the kernel
   dimension and size.

3. Histogram Of Gradients
   Takes in the edges in the image and gradient image and returns Visualisation
   of HOG and HOG value

Here is a Visualisation of HOG.
